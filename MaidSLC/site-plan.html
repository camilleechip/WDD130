      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The main goal of this website is to attract clients who are seeking professional cleaning and 
        organizing services for either their residence or business. Whether clients need a one-time deep 
        cleaning, regular maintenance, or help decluttering their space, this website will serve to inform 
        them about the services offered and allow them to easily book consultations. Clients will be 
        looking for more information regarding the quality of services provided and for reassurance that 
        their home will be treated professionally and with care. Clients will be able to quickly access all 
        the information they need, helping them make an informed decision. A critical aspect of the website's
        design is user experience . It is imperative that the website is relaxing, visually pleasing, and 
        easy to navigate to create a positive first impression. I used calming colors such as lavender and other 
        complimentary colors to give off the sense of relaxation, because cleaning is all about that feeling of
        comfort while sitting in your spotless, organized space. My design focuses on a calm and quality experience 
        without distractions. I am going to ensure that all aspects of my website are easy to find and even easier 
        to use. I hope that this encourages the users to engage with my website and the services offered.

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        This page of the website will include all the photos from previously cleaned homes and give an idea of
        what to expect from this business. One of the main factors that will contribute to attracting potential 
        clients to this website is reference photos. Customers who are considering our services will want to see 
        photos showcasing the exact skills this business will provide and by using before and after photos, we will 
        be ensuring that the potential clients see the quality of our work. Hiring a cleaning company is a commitment 
        and these photos will help customers make that difficult decision to hire a cleaning service. The 
        specific services rendered include deep-cleaning, move out cleans, standard cleans, organizing and 
        much more upon request. Additionally, our cleaners are adaptable, and we pride ourselves on our ability to meet 
        the unique needs of each customer. Whether clients need help organizing a home office, decluttering a garage, or 
        prepping a home for sale, we are equipped to handle a wide variety of tasks. Customers will also be able to book 
        consultations and get a hold of the owners straight from the website.

        In addition to reference photos, this website will provide clear and accessible pricing information. 
        Nobody wants to hire a service if they do not know what the overall cost will be and that is why I will ensure
        that all pricing details are readily available on this page of the website. Clients will not have to go digging either 
        to find pricing because I will have it clearly labeled and organized, minimizing any confusion of frustration. Pricing will
        be broken down by service type, giving the customers full transparency before a consultation is booked. Before a client even
        books an appointment, they will have access to accurate pricing information and be fully aware of the services rendered so there
        are no surprises in cost down the line. This page will have all of my contact information to allow for customers to book a 
        consultation. Monday through Friday, 8am until 4pm will be the hours clientele can expect to have their houses cleaned and this 
        portion of the website will clearly outline that.
