    <p>I enjoy playing video games, lifting weights, walking and spending time with my husband
        and 8 month old. I am currently pursuing a computer science degree! I think that cyber
        security would be a fun career path, but that could change in a year or two. It could
        change after this class. I am excited to learn web design because it could potentially 
        open up a new path for me</p>
    </p>I love the online classes that BYU-Idaho provides because it lets me get an education
        while staying home with my son. I am very excited for this course!</p>
