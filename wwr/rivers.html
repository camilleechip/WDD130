                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <p>We had an incredible season. We celebrate our 50th year of running trips down
                    the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800
                    people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed
                    them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early
                    season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip. Later the
                    temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand Canyon and 95 on the Salmon. 
                    We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                    <h2>Wilderness Encounters</h2>
                    <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share
                        these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what
                        to do if you should find yourself face to face with one. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. 
                        There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal.
                        Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment.
                        The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most
                        venomous in the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their
                        prey and luckily humans are not on that list!
                    </p>
                    <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders
                        and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice, 
                        aspirin and times.
